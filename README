MOLPRO energy reader. Version 2 (java) made by D.A. Snoeken.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains all the java files to read a MOLPRO generated Potential Energy Surface (PES).
The outputfiles generated by MOLPRO in this specific case are all the files that use the extension ".out", e.g. H2-R1.out.
The test potential describes the total energy of the hydrogen molecule (H2) as a function of bond length.
In other words a vibrational potential energy surface.

The main program will create an output that is compatible with scilab (.sce extension is a scilab script). Also it will generate
3 serialized objects and store them in the deser directory.

In the deser directory are the tools to deserialize the necessary objects and also plot the data using the application located in the deser directory. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering the other files:
Cfin.sh -- Compiles all java files, makes deser directory if it doesn't exist and creates the ls.ls file.
Rfin.sh -- Runs all java files, creates ls.ls file.
CRfin.sh -- Combination of Cfin.sh and Rfin.sh. I.e. compiles and then runs.
Rall.sh --  Runs the reading/serialization files, then moves to ./deser and (compiles and) runs the deserializer/plotter.
deser -- directory that contains deserializer and GUI.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering input arguments:
The Rfin.sh will execute the main file using 3 input arguments. This is also the maximum amount of input arguments.
The first one should be the jobname. This is determined from the names of the output file.
The second is an integer that represents the row from the MOLPRO table, where the final answers should come from.
The third and last is an integer that represents the column of the MOLPRO table.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Considering testing:
In order to run the test potential, you can just use the command: "java main H2 1 2" or run Rfin.sh. You can also run CRfin.sh if you wish to compile before running the program.
After this, move to the deser directory and run Rdes.sh or CRdes.sh if you wish to compile first.
Also you can run the command "java deser". The deser class does not require any input arguments.
The deser class will also automatically plot the potential in a GUI. For more help on the GUI, just press the "HELP" button that shows up on screen.
Just make sure that the serialized objects: "addressGeoms.ser", "addressKey.ser" and "addressPotMap.ser" are all stored properly in this directory.
Alternatively, it's also possible to run the Rall.sh script. This just runs everything in the current directory and then also runs everything in the deser directory.
